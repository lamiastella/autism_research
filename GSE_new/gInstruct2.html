Now you will classify concepts. For each concept that appears in the center of the screen, quickly decide if the concept has a positive or negative connotation. If the concept has a positive connotation, press the E key. If the concept has a negative connotation, press the I key, for example,
<br><br>
<i>[the concept prison appears in the center of the screen, with the word POSITIVE in the upper-left hand corner and the word NEGATIVE in the upper-right hand corner with the words “Press the E key if the concept has a POSITIVE connotation or press the I key if the concept has a NEGATIVE connation” at the bottom of the screen. Then, the concept sunrise appears in the center of the screen, again with the word POSITIVE in the upper-left hand corner and the word NEGATIVE in the upper-right hand corner and the words “Press the E key if the concept has a POSITIVE connotation or press the I key if the concept has a NEGATIVE connation” at the bottom of the screen.] </i>
<br><Br>
Again, please rest your index finger of your left-hand on the E key and your index finger of your right-hand on the I key. Go as fast as you can, without making too many errors. If you make an error, a red X will appear in the center of the screen, and you will need to press the space bar to continue.
